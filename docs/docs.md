It is highly recommended to use Paper or a fork of it - Folia is also supported.<br>

## Features

With FancyHolograms you can create fancy holograms that take advantage of the display entities. You are able to create
text, item and block holograms.

Properties you can modify:

- scale
- billoard
- rotation (yaw & pitch)
- background color
- text shadow
- text alignment
- placeholders in the text
- and more ...

The holograms are directly sent to the player via packets, which makes FancyHologram very fast and flexible.
